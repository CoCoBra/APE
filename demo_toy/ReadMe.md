**Tips**:
* This folder contains artificial data files that are only for the demonstration purpose.
* Construct your own csv data in order to run/train.
* events.csv contains historical events for training; test.csv contains future events for test, and should have additional label column.
* Discretize your data if it contains any continuous attributes.
* Avoid same entity names across different fields/columns. If there are, you can avoid so by adding prefix, as done in toy data here.
